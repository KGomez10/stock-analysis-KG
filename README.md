# Overview of Project

The purpose of refactoring the VBA Challenge report is to expand the dataset for 2017 and 2018 to include the entire stock market over those years. By providing more data to analyze, Steve will be able to provide more information to his parents faster. Refactoring the data will allow us to conclude faster and more conclusive data. 

# Results

The results to refactoring the data is that the data for 2017 took 0.004 seconds longer than 2018.
Please view the 2017 and 2018 timeframe screenshots below and the overall data:

Reviewing the the data between both 2017 and 2018 stocks and their returns, we are able to clearly view that 2017 had a much more positive return outcome. In 2017, out fo the 12 tickers, the data shows that only 1 stock reported poorly vs 2018 where only 2 of the 12 tickers had a positive outcome.

# Summary

Refactoring the code for VBA_Challenge data ultimately assisted in shortening execution time and making the code cleaner and easier to read. The previous code had more sections and code with more information but it was bulkier and messier to interpret. 

In conclusion, refactoring the code ultimately benefited the scripts, data, comparison, the visual outcome, and execution time.
